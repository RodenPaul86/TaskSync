## Motivation

<p>
There are plenty of task management apps out there, but only a few strike the right balanceâ€”TaskSync is one of them.

Part of my [portfolio projects](https://paulrodenjr.org/#projects), TaskSync reflects my approach to iOS developmentâ€”delivering practical tools that feel effortless to use.

## Support

I began my journey as an independent developer nearly a decade ago, and TaskSync is the result of years of growth, experimentation, and learning along the way. While Iâ€™ve explored many side projects, TaskSync has become a true passionâ€”my way of helping people stay focused, organized, and in control of their day.

Iâ€™m committed to evolving TaskSync with thoughtful updates, new features, and ongoing improvements. The support from users like you means everythingâ€”itâ€™s what makes this journey possible and keeps TaskSync moving forward.
